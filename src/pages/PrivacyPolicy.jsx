            BY USING ANY OF OUR SITES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY AND TO GPS LLP’S COLLECTION AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SITES.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Information Collected</h2>
          <p>
            We generally collect two types of information from users of the GPS LLP sites: 1) Personal Information ( your name, email address, payment information); and, 2) Non-Personal Information (e.g. cookies or IP address).
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            “Personal Information” is defined as information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, phone numbers, or email address. GPS LLP collects and stores the Personal Information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your Personal Information on the Sites:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A name and an email address so we can notify you about scheduling or send requested information – you would be affirmatively consenting to this by providing this to us in our contact forms.</li>
            <li>Billing information, including name, address, and credit card information, so that we can process payment to deliver our services to you under our contractual obligation.</li>
            <li>A name and an email address if you complete our contact form with a question.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Please note that the information above (“Personal Data”) that you are giving to us is voluntary, and by providing this information to us, you are giving consent for us to use, collect, and process this Personal Data. You are welcome to opt-out or request for us to delete your Personal Data at any point by contacting us.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Data, you may not be able to participate in certain aspects of our website or content.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Retention and Deletion</h3>
          <p>
            We retain your Personal Data for the minimum amount of time necessary to provide you with the information and/or services that you requested from us. We may include certain Personal Data for longer periods of time if necessary for legal, contractual, and accounting obligations.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Sensitive Information</h3>
          <p>
            We ask that you not send us, and you do not share any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., Social Security numbers or detailed accounts of personal experiences or health information). If such information is required as part of the provision of services, we will collect it in a more secure manner.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Anonymous Data Collection and Use</h3>
          <p>
            To maintain our Website’s high quality, we may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Website by identifying which areas of the Website are most heavily used, and to display content according to your preferences. Your IP address is the number assigned to computers connected to the Internet. This is essentially “traffic data” that cannot personally identify you but is helpful to us for marketing purposes and for improving our services. Traffic data collection does not follow a user’s activities on any other websites in any way. Anonymous traffic data may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate basis.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Non-Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            “Non-Personal Information” can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender, ZIP code or other geolocation data, or interests. Non-Personal Information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the Non-Personal Information that is collected via the Sites and a description of how this information is used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Internet Protocol (IP) Address</span> — Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data — such as the web pages you view. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request and to measure traffic within our Sites.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Cookies</span> — Our sites use “cookies” to improve functionality and usability. We use this information for planning, tracking, and improving the technical functions of our Sites. By using our products and agreeing to this Policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with the terms of this Policy.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">About Cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are text files sent by Web servers to Web browsers and are stored on the user’s computer or mobile device. If the browser is loading a page and the server requests the information stored in the cookie, the cookie is sent back to the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies contain data about the user’s activities on the website and can be used by Web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a website, and to identify users returning to a website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cookies may be either “persistent” or “session” cookies. A persistent cookie will remain valid until its set expiration date (unless deleted by the user). A session cookie will expire at the end of the user session when the Web browser is closed.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">Blocking cookies</h4>
          <p>
            Most browsers allow users to refuse to accept cookies.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In Google Chrome, you can adjust your cookie permissions by clicking “Options,” “Under the hood,” and Content Settings in the “Privacy” section. Click on the Cookies tab in the Content Settings.</li>
            <li>In Safari, you can block cookies by clicking “Preferences,” selecting the “Privacy” tab and “Block cookies.”</li>
            <li>In Internet Explorer, you can refuse all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Internet Options,” “Privacy,” and selecting “Block all cookies” using the sliding selector.</li>
            <li>In Firefox, you can block all cookies by clicking “Tools,” “Options,” and un-checking “Accept cookies from sites” in the “Privacy” box.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact on the usability of many websites. If you block cookies, you may not be able to log on, access content, or use search functions, for example.
          </p>

          <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-primary mt-4 mb-2">Deleting cookies</h4>
          <p>
            Users can also delete cookies already stored on their computers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In Google Chrome, you can adjust your cookie permissions by clicking “Options,” “Under the hood,” and Content Settings in the “Privacy” section. Click on the Cookies tab in the Content Settings.</li>
            <li>In Safari, you can delete cookies by clicking “Preferences,” selecting the “Privacy” tab, and selecting “Remove All Website Data.”</li>
            <li>In Internet Explorer, you must manually delete cookie files.</li>
            <li>In Firefox, you can delete cookies by first ensuring that cookies are to be deleted when you “clear private data” (this setting can be changed by clicking “Tools,” “Options,” and “Settings” in the “Private Data” box) and then clicking “Clear private data” in the “Tools” menu.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Doing this may have a negative impact on the usability of many websites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Use of Information Collected Via the Sites</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            We use your Personal Information that we collect on the Sites primarily for the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>To deliver services, such as information or newsletters you request or purchase;</li>
            <li>To let you know about updated information and other new services from GPS LLP</li>

            <li>To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;</li>
            <li>To request your feedback about your experience with GPS LLP;</li>
            <li>To notify you about a material change to this Policy, if necessary; and</li>
            <li>To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Sites.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Non-Personal Information</h3>
          <p>
            Non-Personal Information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining Non-Personal Information with Personal Information.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Release of Information to Third Parties</h2>
          <p>
            By using the Sites you grant GPS LLP the right to use your Non-Personal Information for marketing and to improve the Sites. This use may involve the disclosure of your Non-Personal Information to third parties. GPS LLP will not share or disclose your Personal Information with third parties.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Third Party Websites and Advertisers</h2>
          <p>
            The Sites may provide you with links to other websites, although we do not necessarily advise that you link to another website. In the event that you choose to access such websites, GPS LLP is not responsible for any actions or policies of those sites. Further, please note that the third party’s privacy policies and security practices may differ from GPS LLP standards. GPS LLP neither assumes responsibility for, nor does it control, endorse, or guarantee any aspect of your use of any linked sites. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of such a party before providing Personal Information to it.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Opt-Out</h2>
          <p>
            We communicate with our clients on a regular basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, clients cannot opt out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communications from us, such as messages or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on the Sites. If you choose to opt-in for such outreach and later choose to opt-out, you can contact us by email at contact@greyrockpsych.com. We will process your request to opt-out as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances, you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed. Please note that electing to opt-out of our promotional emails does not mean that we will delete or remove your email address from our systems.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Changes in Our Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            GPS LLP reserves the right to make changes to this Policy at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Any changes to this Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of our current policies. We may also contact you by email with changes. Additionally, we will update the “last updated” date below.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Website Security</h2>
          <p>
            No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you understand that any information that you transfer to GPS LLP is done at your own risk. However, GPS LLP uses website security measures consistent with current best practices to protect the Sites, email, and mailing lists. These measures include technical, procedural, monitoring, and tracking steps intended to safeguard data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            We realize there can be incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions, as almost every website, service, and user encounters. In those instances, our goals are to move quickly to isolate the problem, ensure or restore proper functionality and minimize any inconvenience to our users. As appropriate and necessary, GPS LLP will notify the relevant authorities of these incidents of misuse or unauthorized program incursions of the GPS LLP Sites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Assignment</h2>
          <p>
            In the event that all or part of GPS LLP’s assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a merger, you grant GPS LLP the right to assign the Personal and Non-Personal Information collected via the Sites.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">What We Do With Information We Collect</h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Contact You</h3>
          <p>
            We may contact you with information that you provide to us based on these lawful grounds for processing:
          </p>

            <li><span className="font-semibold">Contract.</span> We will contact you under our contractual obligation to deliver goods or services you purchase from us.</li>
            <li><span className="font-semibold">Legitimate Interest.</span> We may contact you if we feel you have a legitimate interest in hearing from us. For example, if you sign up for a webinar, we may send you marketing emails based on the content of that webinar. You will always have the option to opt out of any of our emails.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Process Payments</h3>
          <p>
            We will use the Personal Data you give to us in order to process your payment for the purchase of goods or services under a contract. We only use third-party payment processors that take the utmost care in securing data and comply with the GDPR.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Share with Third Parties</h3>
          <p>
            We may share your information with trusted third parties, such as our newsletter provider, in order to contact you via email or our merchant accounts to process payments.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mt-6 mb-3">Viewing by Others</h3>
          <p>
            Note that whenever you voluntarily make your Personal Data available for viewing by others online through this Website or its content, it may be seen, collected, and used by others, and therefore, we cannot be responsible for any unauthorized or improper use of the information that you voluntarily share (i.e., sharing a comment on a blog post, posting in a Facebook group that we manage, sharing details on a group coaching call, etc.).
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Submission, Storage, Sharing, and Transferring of Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            Personal Data that you provide to us is stored internally or through a data management system. Your Personal Data will only be accessed by those who help to obtain, manage, or store that information, or who have a legitimate need to know such Personal Data (i.e., our hosting provider, newsletter provider, payment processors, or team members).
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to note that we may transfer data internationally. For users in the European Union, please be aware that we transfer Personal Data outside of the European Union. By using our Website and providing us with your Personal Data, you consent to these transfers in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
          </p>

          <p>
            We retain your Personal Data for the minimum amount of time necessary to provide you with the information and/or services that you requested from us. We may include certain Personal Data for longer periods of time if necessary for legal, contractual, and accounting obligations.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            We aim to keep the Personal Data that you share with us confidential. Please note that we may disclose such information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that: (1) such action is necessary to protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users or licensees, (2) to act as immediately necessary in order to protect the personal safety or rights of our users or the public, or (3) to investigate or respond to any real or perceived violation of this Privacy Policy or of our Disclaimer, Terms and Conditions, or any other terms of use or agreement with us.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">Passwords</h2>
          <p>
            To use certain features of the Website or its content, you may need a username and password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the username and password, and you are responsible for all activities, whether by you or by others, that occur under your username or password and within your account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your username, password, or account information. If you share your username or password with others, they may be able to obtain access to your Personal Data at your own risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized or improper use of your username or password or any other breach of security. To help protect against unauthorized or improper use, make sure that you log out at the end of each session, requiring your username and password.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use our best efforts to keep your username and password(s) private and will not otherwise share your password(s) without your consent, except as necessary when the law requires it or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary, particularly when disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to others or interfering with our rights or property.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-primary mt-8 mb-4">How You Can Access, Update, or Delete Your Personal Data</h2>
